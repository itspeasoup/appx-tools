# appx-tools

so uhh

basically the series of appx commands but they're slammed in a tkinter gui



when you open the exe file (it takes some time tho), you'll be met with this window:

it's nicely resizable though!

now, if you have the ability to read and already have some experience with using the appx powershell commands, you probably don't even need this tutorial at all.


## the list!!!!!

the list just shows you whatever the hell is loaded into the list, showing the path too.

### dumb controls LIKE WHY DO YOU NEED THIS TUTORIAL MAN

you're gonna see three buttons. the middle button is padded a TINY bit higher than the ones on the sides, intentionally

![obrazek](https://github.com/itspeasoup/appx-tools/assets/107713251/2e1d953a-566e-4a25-a7e3-8bd85c26cfca)



these buttons are self-explanatory, with the "add appx files" button... adding the appx files - yes i'm gonna call everything appx files because that's what i am used to, even though there are msix files (yes there IS msix support.)
> that button can be used multiple times, so yes, you can add all the appx files you want



> [!WARNING]
> BUT if you're gonna try and add duplicates, then you're gonna get ONE error message for EVERY duplicate you import haha


"clear all" of course clears everything from the list


### Download Free AppX and MsiX files No Ads

ah, the glory. the ultimate "download appx files online" button.


when you click that, the program tells the `webbrowser` package "Hey, open a new tab in the user's default browser with this website" and the `webbrowser` package then responds with "Okay, I'm on it!" and voil√†, this [really fucking gross website](https://store.rg-adguard.net/) opens in your default browser.

yes, i know. it looks sketchy and all, but it is widely known in a group of people who use appx to fix or download missing appx packages online.

so, i need you to click the lil' box with "RP" written on it. it reveals ***ANOTHER list!***
select retail.

if you're wondering what that is about, it's actually the releases from the files you are going to get.

in the middle url bar, you paste in the url of the UWP (universal windows piece-of-shit)
i'm gonna be putting in "[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/roblox/9nblgggzm6wm?ocid=storeforweb](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/roblox/9nblgggzm6wm?ocid=storeforweb)" because roblox is basically now on every platform


...

you wait.

# AND IT'S ANOTHER FUCKING LIST OH MY GOD I WANT TO KILL MYSELF

now, you can divide the list into two parts - dependencies and the build. think of it like downloading a minecraft forge mod (you need every mod in existence to have it crashed afterwards)

the dependencies are mostly libraries like VCLibs from microsoft and shit.

now look **C A R E F U L L Y** because you want the one that is made for your processor.

![obrazek](https://github.com/itspeasoup/appx-tools/assets/107713251/30c58f9d-706e-47f0-bfa9-9db347bf908f)

you need to download either an .appx or a .msix file, not the blockmaps (ew)
i have an x64 processor, so i'll be downloading THIS file:

![obrazek](https://github.com/itspeasoup/appx-tools/assets/107713251/9a72bb7e-33a1-4488-848e-ac664d8b9993)


also download the msix/appx bundle with it, you're gonna need it later

![obrazek](https://github.com/itspeasoup/appx-tools/assets/107713251/0e374604-dea2-485f-b98a-90bfc24aca1c)


if you use firefox, it may show you that "soegnjdkllskm its getting downloaded from http it can be changed while its download" SHUT THE FUCK UP IT'S NOT GONNA BLOW UP YOUR PC


after that, go back to your gui and click "add appx files" and then select your file/s
(it's impossible for you to miss those files as the file visibility is filtered)

![obrazek](https://github.com/itspeasoup/appx-tools/assets/107713251/62935ed5-53f5-4ae9-9104-41cfc1ba6c7c)


then, click the "install selected appx files" button. it's going to tell `powershell` to install the package/s into your computer.


then, click "install bundle" and select your bundle (it is gonna get installed instantly)

## programus removus

this cute little button in the bottom left is a **tool capable of destruction.**

when you click on it, another window opens.

![obrazek](https://github.com/itspeasoup/appx-tools/assets/107713251/693398c8-79ef-4844-a977-88c2598644ed)


when you click on a package in this list, it selects that package. you can click on other packages and it selects them too.
clicking the "uninstall selected" button, well, uninstalls those packages.


# congratulations your did it goodbye im gonna slep
